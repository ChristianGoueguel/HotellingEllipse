#' @title LIBS spectra of 171 soil samples
#' @description A dataset containing the emission spectra of 171 soils measured in laboratory conditions.
#' The samples were cleaned, dried, homogenized, sieved (10 Mesh size) and thereafter pelletized prior to LIBS measurements.
#' LIBS spectra were preprocessed by performing baseline removal.
#' @format Data frame of 171 rows (soil samples) and 6670 columns (wavelengths).
