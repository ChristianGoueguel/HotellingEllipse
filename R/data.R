#' @title LIBS spectra of 100 soil samples
#' @description A dataset containing the emission spectra of 100 soils measured in laboratory conditions.
#' The samples were cleaned, dried, homogenized, sieved (10 Mesh size) and thereafter pelletized prior to LIBS measurements.
#' LIBS spectra were preprocessed by performing baseline removal.
#' @format Data frame of 100 rows (soil samples) and 3152 columns (wavelengths).
