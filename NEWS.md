# HotellingEllipse 1.1.0
This version includes (1) a correction of an error that occurred in the `ellipseParam` and `ellipseCoord `functions, when data is data.frame, instead of tibble; (2) an improvement of the package documentation; (3) changes in the vignette (the difference between `ellipseParam` and `ellipseCoord` functions to draw Hotelling's ellipse is much clearer for users).
